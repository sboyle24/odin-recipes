    <p><em>The "Turducken" is an invention of intrusive thought and a disturbed mind</em></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3-5 lb whole turkey, plucked and prepared</li>
        <li>1-3 lb whole duck, plucked and prepared</li>
        <li>10 sprigs fresh parsley</li>
        <li>Loose boundaries</li>
        <li>A coarse and unrefined palette</li>
        <li>5 tbsp olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cooking Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat steel refinery to 10,000 degrees fahrenheight</li>
        <li>Coat the duck in olive oil and 3-5 ground sprigs of parsley</li>
        <li>Forcefully jam the duck into the turkey, ensuring to align the rears of both fowl</li>
        <li>Coat the turkey in olive oil and 5-7 ground sprigs of parsley</li>
        <li>Give the turkey a slap with your palm to test for noise conduction. A successfully assembled turducken should have a hollow sound like a ripe watermelon</li>
        <li>Close your eyes and imagine all of your negative feelings and self-doubt as a cube placed inside of the turducken like a russian nesting doll of humanity's hubris</li>
        <li>Dropkick the turducken into the refinery and walk away before the turducken awakens as a golem</li>
    </ol>
